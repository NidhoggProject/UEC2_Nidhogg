2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net my_keyboard/my_PS2Receiver/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin my_keyboard/my_PS2Receiver/rgb_out_nxt_reg[11]_i_1__0/O, cell my_keyboard/my_PS2Receiver/rgb_out_nxt_reg[11]_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net my_keyboard/my_PS2Receiver/RP_x_pos_reg[11][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin my_keyboard/my_PS2Receiver/RP_x_pos_nxt_reg[11]_i_1/O, cell my_keyboard/my_PS2Receiver/RP_x_pos_nxt_reg[11]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net my_timing/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin my_timing/rgb_out_nxt_reg[11]_i_2/O, cell my_timing/rgb_out_nxt_reg[11]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
